# Instructions

Scrapes Drug names from [druginfo.nlm.nih.gov](https://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/drug/names/a) using bs4 and requests.

This script is designed to pull drug names from the website and return a pandas dataframe for use in various applications. I am not responsible for any misuse of this script. It implements a sleeping time to limit the rate of requests to the website.
